<p>
    You are given an array of positive integers and a number (<strong>n</strong>).
    Try to find the greatest possible product of <strong>n</strong> elements in a consecutive series
    for the given array.
</p>
<p>
    For example: array=[1,2,3,5,1,6,1] and n=2.
    The corresponding consecutive series are [1,2], [2,3],
    [3,5], [5,1], [1,6], [6,1], their products are 2, 6, 15, 5, 6, 6.
    The final result is 15.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. An array as a list of integers and a number <strong>n</strong> as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The greatest possible product as an integer.
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio([1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 1], 2) == 15
checkio([1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 2], 3) == 84
    </pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This a simple exercise for working with a consecutive data types.
</p>

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>

    1 &le; n &le; 10<br>
    n &le; len(array)
